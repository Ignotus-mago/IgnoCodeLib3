/**
Package <code>net.paulhertz.geom</code> provides classes that handle geometric transforms.
The <code>Matrix3</code> class provides extensive methods for performing geometric transforms
of coordinate points through matrix multiplication.
The <code>GeomUtils</code> class provides methods to rotate, scale, and translate coordinate points. 
In some situations, its methods may be faster than matrix mulitplication, but they lack the 
generality provided by matrix methods.
Two additional classes, <code>Turtle</code> and <code>TurtleState</code> supply a basic TurtleGraphics
capability.
