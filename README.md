# IgnoCodeLib3

A library by Paul Hertz for the Processing programming environment.

Hierarchical display list for graphics and text with export to Adobe Illustrator 7.0 file format. Supports display and output of complex objects composed of lines and cubic Bezier curves, simple text, RGB and CMYK color, and geometric transforms. 

This is the development source for the next release of the IgnoCodeLib library, for Processing 4.0. It can be compiled to a Processing library using the Processing Library Template (directory: processing-library-template-3.0.1). You will need to change the library template settings for your own computer if you want to compile the IgnoCodeLib library. A downloadable .zip file is available in the download directory. 

At the moment, I am clearing up problems with the current version. I expect to go on to add the following features for the next release: Point-thinning, brushstroke modeling, Lab colorspace. The first two are well underway. I expect them to show up first in a fork of this code.
