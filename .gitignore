# Our own stuff to ignore #
###########################
# we won't include libraries such as our local copy of core.jar
# we'll skip Eclipse's files that refer to the local setup and system
# and also ignore the bin directory with compiled code and settings
/libs
/.settings
/.project
/.classpath
/bin
# and for the moment let's ignore the template and distribution files #
/processing-library-template-3.0.1

# Compiled source #
###################
*.com
*.class
*.dll
*.exe
*.o
*.so

# Packages #

# it's better to unpack these files and commit the raw source
# git has its own built in compression methods
